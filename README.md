# ðŸ¤–Solana Pumpfun Sniper

You can snipe and trade tokens on pumpfun.

You can filter tokens by creator or token ticker/symbol.

 (Yellowstone gRPC + jito + nextblock + bloxroute + temperal)

## Update Version2(Yellowstone GRPC mode)

I completed version2 that can snipe in 1 or 2 blocks after mint.
